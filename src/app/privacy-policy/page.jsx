              <h3>Personal information</h3>
              <p>
                When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including
                information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on
                your device. Information about how you access the website, your account, email address, your profile
                picture, language preferences. By signing up for Google Analytics, you agree that Omegatheme can see and
                download your Google Analytics data to sync in your account on Sasi.work. We just pull the Google
                Analytics data as is without editing or attaching them to any sources that render the data identifiable
                to anyone, other than the corresponding authorized user of the Google Analytics account themselves.
                <br />
                Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or products
                that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you
                interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information.”
              </p>
              <h3>Credit Card Information</h3>
              <p>
                If you use a credit card to purchase an account via this site, your name as it appears on the credit
                card, the credit card number, expiration date, and billing address will be encrypted as it passes over
                the Internet. Omegatheme does not record or keep your credit card information for online credit-card
                transactions; rather such information is simply passed through to our contracted payment processing
                vendor (PayPal, MoneyBookers, etc.). Omegatheme may access such information through the payment
                processing company, but does not do so except to process refunds or adjustments and to the extent
                necessary in the event of nonpayment or disputed payments, or as may be necessary for Omegatheme'
                compliance, in Omegatheme' discretion, with applicable law.

              <h3>Information for Technical Support</h3>
              <p>
                When we get your request for online technical support, we will ask you for the necessary information to
                complete the transaction such as your name, email address, and information about your computer hardware,
                software, hosting, and the nature of the problem you are experiencing. Such transmissions and storing of
                your data are secure.

              <p>We collect Device Information using the following technologies:</p>
              <h2 id="pp-site-functionality">4. Site Functionality</h2>
              <h3>Cookies</h3>
              <p>
                A "cookie" is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user.
                Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our Site. Once
                you close your browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our Site, you
                would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our Site. You may still
                use our Site if you reject the cookie. The only drawback to this is that you will be limited in some
                areas of our Site. For example, you will not be able to use certain features of our forum or other parts
                of the Site that offer customized settings.
              </p>
              <h3>Log Files</h3>
              <p>
                We (Omegatheme and/or our contracted web analytics provider(s)) do keep track of the domains from which
                you access our Site and Services on the World Wide Web, and may log IP addresses or other identifiers
                for statistical purposes. We do this to gather broad demographic information for aggregate use to
                identify and analyze trends and the results of our marketing efforts, to help diagnose problems with our
                servers and to administer the Site and Services, and analyze users' movements. We may periodically share
                aggregated demographic information with our business partners. IP addresses and other identifiers are
                not linked to personally identifiable information.
              </p>
              <h3>Links to other websites</h3>

                services.

              <h2 id="pp-change-your-info">Security of Your Information</h2>
